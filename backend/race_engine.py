Uma Musume Race Simulation Engine
=================================
Combines authentic mechanics from:
- umamusu.wiki/Game:Mechanics (exact formulas)
- gametora.com/umamusume/race-mechanics (detailed mechanics descriptions)

CORE FORMULAS (from Wiki):
--------------------------
Base Speed:
    BaseSpeed = 20.0 - (CourseDistance - 2000m) / 1000 [m/s]
    Example: 1200m = 20.8 m/s, 2000m = 20.0 m/s, 2500m = 19.5 m/s

Base Target Speed (Opening/Middle Leg):
    BaseTargetSpeed = BaseSpeed × StrategyPhaseCoef
    NOTE: Speed stat does NOT affect this!

Base Target Speed (Final Leg/Last Spurt):
    BaseTargetSpeed = BaseSpeed × StrategyPhaseCoef + sqrt(500 × SpeedStat) × DistProf × 0.002

Acceleration:
    Accel = BaseAccel × sqrt(500.0 × PowerStat) × StrategyPhaseCoef × GroundProf × DistProf
    BaseAccel = 0.0006 m/s² (normal), 0.0004 m/s² (uphill)
    Start Dash: +24.0 m/s² additional acceleration until speed reaches 0.85 × BaseSpeed

HP (Stamina):
    MaxHP = 0.8 × StrategyCoef × StaminaStat + CourseDistance[m]
    HPConsumption = 20.0 × (CurrentSpeed - BaseSpeed + 12.0)² / 144.0 × Modifiers

Guts (Final Leg):
    GutsModifier = 1.0 + (200 / sqrt(600.0 × GutsStat))
    HP consumption multiplied by GutsModifier in final leg/last spurt

Minimum Speed:
    MinSpeed = 0.85 × BaseSpeed + sqrt(200.0 × GutsStat) × 0.001 [m/s]

Stats Soft Cap:
    Stats past 1200 are halved before calculations

MOOD SYSTEM (NEW):
------------------
Base stats are modified by mood before calculations:
    Awful: 0.96x, Bad: 0.98x, Normal: 1.0x, Good: 1.02x, Great: 1.04x

LANE SYSTEM (NEW):
------------------
- Lane measured in course width (1 course width = 11.25m)
- Horse lane unit = 1/18 course width
- Lane change speed: TargetSpeed = 0.02 × (0.3 + 0.001 × Power) × modifiers
- Moving inward is faster than outward

BLOCKING SYSTEM (NEW):
----------------------
Front Blocking: 0 < DistanceGap < 2m, LaneGap < (1-0.6×gap/2)×0.75 horse lane
    Speed capped to (0.988 + 0.012 × gap/2) × blocker speed
Side Blocking: |DistanceGap| < 1.05m, LaneGap < 2 horse lane
Overlapping: |DistanceGap| < 0.4m, LaneGap < 0.4 horse lane → bump outer 0.4 lane

POSITION KEEP MODES (NEW):
--------------------------
FR Speed Up: 1.04x (first place, <4.5m ahead)
FR Overtake: 1.05x (not first among FR)
Non-Runner Pace Up: 1.04x (too far from pacemaker)
Non-Runner Pace Down: 0.945x middle / 0.915x other (too close to pacemaker)
Pace Up EX: 2.0x (wrong strategy order)

COMPETITION SYSTEM (NEW):
-------------------------
Lead Competition: FR within 3.75m, 1.4x HP (3.6x with Rushed)
Competition Fight: Final straight, within 3m for 2s, Guts bonus
Compete Before Spurt: Section 11-15, speed boost at stamina cost
Secure Lead: Section 11-15, maintain lead vs lower strategies
Stamina Keep: Conserve HP, 30% chance per 2s based on Wisdom

SLOPE SYSTEM (NEW):
-------------------
Uphill: Target speed -= SlopePer × 200/Power, BaseAccel = 0.0004
Downhill: Wit×0.04% per second chance to enter accel mode (+0.3 m/s, -60% HP)

LIMIT BREAK (NEW):
------------------
Power > 1200: Conserve power, release at spurt for accel boost
Stamina > 1200: Target speed buff = sqrt(Stamina-1200) × 0.0085 × DistFactor
